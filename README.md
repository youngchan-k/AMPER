# AMPER (Aim-Measure-Predict-Evaluate-Recommend): The Paradigm of Digital Me

AMPER is a general Digital Me algorithm to manage the individual¡¯s state in real-time. We verify our proposed algorithm structure with [EdNet KT1 dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AmGcOs5U31wIIqvthn9ARqJMrMTFTcaw/view) for the user-centric aim of improving the user's English score. 

Please refer to the [paper](https://youngchan-k.github.io/assets/paper/ICEC2022/AMPER.pdf) and [slide](https://youngchan-k.github.io/assets/paper/ICEC2022/AMPER_slide.pdf) if you want to see more details.
